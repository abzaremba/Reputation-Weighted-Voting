# Social Learning and Decision Making - relevance for voting mechanisms.

These notes have been inspired and mostly informed by the podcast from the series "Complexity: Physics of Life", [Mirta Galesic on social learning & decision-making](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7m3lEMqnkEDgZcKesiepcn?si=eVM78EcYRJ6Hfd9o6oRHDw&nd=1&dlsi=3e3854f7ea6b476f). I summarise some of the most interesting concepts, provide bibliography for the research and point out their relevance to the voting mechanism design, or governance in general.


## Areas of relevance:

1. Voting **algorithm**
2. **Communication** related to voting
3. Interaction with the community more broadly
4. Which **values** should (ideally) be consistent with the voting mechanism
5. What functions should be fulfilled by the voting mechanism.
6. Understanding possible **behaviours**: motivations, biases etc.
7. **Analysing** the proposed mechanisms.


## Summary of the concepts / research.

### Impact of social networks on learning and decision making.

>  One of the main points from the podcast and from research by Prof Mirta Galesic is that the social network element impacts both learning and decision making, and especially the aspect related to bias, in a way that has been underappreciated or misunderstood by a lot of research. Further, Galesic conjectures that there are a lot of biases that are products of imperfect measurements, and that they go away after incorporating information about social networks.

One of the important pieces of research that Galesic refers to, is the one that shows that:
* People are very good at predicting preferences of their social circle, to the extent that the social circle question can predict election results better than asking about own voting intentions.
* While people have a good understanding of opinions of people from their social circle, this will not be the case for people outside of that social circle.
* People are less biassed when judging opinions from own social circles, but are more biassed when asked to make judgement about opinions of other circles, and the biases tend to be connected to what they know about those social circles.

Consequently: ***the more biased is the social network, the more biased will be the estimate for the whole population.*** These structures of social networks is what explains overall biases of judgement of the broader population, rather than some cognitive deficits of motivational biases. 

How can one **correct for this handicap**?
* People who have most diverse social networks are the most able to predict societal trends.
* Policy makers should have as big social networks as possible, they should include those people who are often not there.



### When smaller groups outperform bigger groups in decision making.

> What's the best way to approach a problem and decision-making if we don't know the complexity of the problem in advance?

Three elements to consider:
* Rule used to make decision
* Network structure, especially: how many diverse opinions are in the personâ€™s network
* Problem being solved.

Example:

If there is a simple problem, it might be the best to follow the opinion of a group member who currently has best solution. But if a problem is complex, this strategy might lead to choosing suboptimal solution. 

However if a solution exists and is known, or is easy to find, diversity of opinions can be a problem here.
Controversial issue: once a society has come to a solution to a long standing problem, for example a scientific fact, then inviting people to have opinions about it - can be detrimental.

Interesting point: separation of information gathering from decision making.
